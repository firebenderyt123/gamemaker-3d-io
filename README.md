# gamemaker-3d-io
A Blender addon which exports 3D models to a format that GameMaker Studio 2 will read natively.

This is a continuation of the GameMaker D3D and GML script addons for Blender 2.7x, recreated from the ground up to work with Blender 2.93. This version of the addon can export directly to a vertex buffer format that GameMaker Studio 2 will load/read natively, or to a GML script (mostly for debugging purposes) that can be put into a GameMaker project.

Not all of the options from the original plugin are present in this version, but most were superfluous and didn't need to be carried over.

This addon is a work-in-progress; more documentation will follow shortly. Thanks!
